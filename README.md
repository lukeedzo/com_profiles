## About The Component

The component is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. It allows users to import scientist profiles from an excel file, making it easy to manage large amounts of data. Once the profiles are imported, the component provides an intuitive interface for editing and updating the profiles.

The profiles can be displayed in any desired location on the website, providing a convenient way to showcase the profiles of scientists, researchers, or any other professionals. The component also provides a range of customization options, allowing users to customize the look and feel of the profiles to match their website.

In addition to its user-friendly design, the component is also highly functional. It provides a range of features, including the ability to group profiles by letter, display the scientist's name, degree, positions, email, publication list, and external profiles. The component also makes it easy to search for profiles, making it easy for users to find the information they need.

<hr>
This Joomla component can also serve as a starting point for your own custom components. Instead of starting from scratch, you can use the code and structure of the sample component as a foundation, making it easier and faster to build your own custom components.
